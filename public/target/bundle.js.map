signing up and uploading your Mounatin Project data the application displays climbing areas sized by the number of your Mountain Project Ticks and ToDos.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tCharts are used throughout to display the breakdown of climb rating (using YDS), type (ex: boulder, sport, traditional) by area, and height (in pitches).\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tIn addition to visualizing your existing data, logged-in users have the ability to add and edit climbing areas in the system to help better map Mountain Project Tick/ToDo data against Climb Mapper climbing areas.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tThis is an experiment and side project and so any collaboration is welcome.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\tAll the scrapy code is available on <a

Picture</h4>\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI am tired of not being able to build useful tools for the climbing and outdoor community because of a lack of data.\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are a number of websites out there actively crowd sourcing climbing area data from people just like you but never returning that data back to the community as open data.\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>NOTE:</b> Mountain Project was kind enough to make some data available through an API which helps power ClimbMapper (which is pretty damn great).\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is a problem because it makes it even harder for people like me to build free or inexpensive apps due to the overhead of collecting that same data WHILE then being forced to compete with other crowd sourcing websites that would be much better as partners than competitors.\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf ClimbMapper is at all successful I would like to build out the data management functionality so WE can collect more types of data to be used in other ways.\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith this open model developers like me can work on projects that affect the whole climbing community like building an application to help the Access Fund identify bad hardware and coordinate with those amazing teams that replace bad hardware to keep us happy and safe.\n        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n

are imported from <a href=\"http://www.mountainproject.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain Project</a>.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\tAll climbing area data is created by Climb Mapper users independent of Mountain Project.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\tAll user submitted data will be open sourced for other applications to use in hopes that a common data source openly shared will benefit other future applications that help engage in this sport we love so much.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t</p>\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t</div>\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t<div>\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t<h4>An Important

application attempts to assign routes to climbing areas based on name matching.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\tThis is problematic because it means that climbing areas in Climb Mapper must grammatically match a name in the location hierarchy of a route on Mountain Project.\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\tFor example, if a route on Mountain Project has a location hierarchy (found at top of page) like this \"All Locations > California > Yosemite National Park > Tuolumne Meadows > Cathedral Range > Cathedral Peak\" then an area in Climb Mapper must exist that has one of those names between the \">\" symbols (i.e. Yosemite National Park).\n      \t\t\t\t    \t\t\t\t\tIf there these location names do not match up the route will not be matched to an area in Climb Mapper.\n      \t\t\t\t
